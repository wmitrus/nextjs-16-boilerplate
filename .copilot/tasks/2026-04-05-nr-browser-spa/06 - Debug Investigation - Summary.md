# 06 - Debug Investigation - Summary

## Task Context

- Task ID: `2026-04-05-nr-browser-spa`
- Task Objective: replace APM browser injection with SPA-compatible request-time Node route delivery for New Relic Browser monitoring
- Current Run Scope: Pass 4 — three post-implementation runtime issues: NR SPA agent crash on hard refresh, "uncaught" error classification in browser, duplicate NR Browser entities, and `{}` in log output
- Status: COMPLETED
- Last Updated: 2026-04-06
- Related Control Artifacts: `plan.md`, `validation-report.md`, `04 - Implementation Agent - Summary.md`

---

## Scope Handled

### Pass 1 (2026-04-05)

- symptom or flow investigated: preview deploy build failure during static generation of `/observability/new-relic-browser.js`
- runtime surfaces investigated: App Router route handler prerender path, layout script-loader path, env-driven route branching
- env or timing questions investigated: behavior when `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED` is unset or explicitly false in preview/build environments

### Pass 2 (2026-04-06 — Vercel env-size follow-up)

- symptom or flow investigated: 88 KB browser snippet exceeds documented Vercel per-variable limit; deployment env-var transport is infeasible for large snippets
- runtime surfaces investigated: request-time Node route as primary delivery path; env-backed snippet as local/dev fallback only

### Pass 3 (2026-04-06 — cacheComponents regression)

- symptom or flow investigated: HMR build error after refactor introduced `export const runtime` and `export const dynamic` into the route, which are banned by `nextConfig.cacheComponents: true`
- runtime surfaces investigated: Turbopack transform layer (compile-time enforcement), route handler dynamic rendering opt-in
- env or timing questions investigated: whether removing the segment configs leaves the route vulnerable to prerender and the `Date.now()` constraint

---

## Inputs Reviewed

### Pass 3

- code paths reviewed:
  - `src/app/observability/new-relic-browser.js/route.ts` — exports `runtime` and `dynamic`
  - `next.config.ts` — confirms `cacheComponents: true`
  - `src/core/observability/new-relic.ts` — confirms `getBrowserAgentScriptSafe()` calls `getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe()` which invokes the NR agent at request time (calls `Date.now()` internally)
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` — references the route via `<Script src="/observability/new-relic-browser.js" strategy="beforeInteractive" />`
  - `src/app/observability/new-relic-browser.js/route.test.ts` — imports and asserts both banned exports
  - `src/app/feature-flags-demo/page.tsx`, `src/app/sign-in`, `src/app/sign-up`, `src/app/users/layout` — confirmed established `connection()` pattern
- logs / diagnostics reviewed: browser DevTools console output showing repeated HMR websocket error loop for both `runtime` and `dynamic` config violations
- tests / task artifacts reviewed: `route.test.ts`, `plan.md`, `04 - Implementation Agent - Summary.md`

---

## Actions Performed

### Pass 3

- execution-path tracing performed: traced compile error from Turbopack transform through `route.ts` exports to `cacheComponents` enforcement in Next.js 16.2.2
- source-of-truth tracing performed: verified `cacheComponents: true` in `next.config.ts`; audited all `export const dynamic` and `export const runtime` occurrences across all non-test app files — only one instance exists (the failing route)
- evidence collection performed: confirmed `connection()` is the established codebase-wide pattern for dynamic opt-in; confirmed `getBrowserAgentScriptSafe()` must not prerender due to NR `Date.now()` constraint

---

## Symptom Summary

### Pass 1

- observed symptom: preview deployment fails during static generation with `TypeError: Response constructor: Invalid response status code 204`
- where it surfaces: build/prerender phase for `/observability/new-relic-browser.js`
- reproducibility: deterministic when `NEW_RELIC_ENABLED=false` or unset and no browser snippet is configured
- trigger conditions: route returns `new NextResponse('', { status: 204 })` — a body is not permitted on a 204

### Pass 3

- observed symptom: Turbopack HMR and build both refuse to compile the route with two errors repeating in a loop:
  - `Route segment config "dynamic" is not compatible with nextConfig.cacheComponents. Please remove it.`
  - `Route segment config "runtime" is not compatible with nextConfig.cacheComponents. Please remove it.`
- where it surfaces: compile-time, `src/app/observability/new-relic-browser.js/route.ts` lines 6–7; secondary symptom is `POST /api/logs 500` from `GlobalErrorHandlers` attempting to log the repeated HMR error
- reproducibility: deterministic — 100% on every dev server start and every HMR cycle
- trigger conditions: `cacheComponents: true` in `next.config.ts` combined with `export const runtime` or `export const dynamic` in any App Router route segment

---

## Confirmed Evidence

### Pass 3

- code facts:
  - **Confirmed** — `next.config.ts` has `cacheComponents: true` (Cache Components model, PPR-compatible)
  - **Confirmed** — `route.ts` exports `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` (line 6) and `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (line 7)
  - **Confirmed** — Next.js 16 with `cacheComponents: true` forbids both `runtime` and `dynamic` route segment config exports; this is a compile-time hard error enforced by the Turbopack transform layer
  - **Confirmed** — these are the **only** two `export const dynamic` / `export const runtime` declarations in all non-test App Router files; no other route is affected
  - **Confirmed** — `route.test.ts` imports both banned exports by name and asserts their values; the test will fail as a direct consequence of removing the exports
  - **Confirmed** — `getBrowserAgentScriptSafe()` calls `getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe()` which calls `nr.getBrowserTimingHeader()` — the NR agent records `Date.now()` internally; this must never be called from a prerenderable path (AGENTS.md constraint)
  - **Confirmed** — `connection()` from `next/server` is the established codebase-wide opt-in for dynamic rendering (used in `feature-flags-demo`, `sign-in`, `sign-up`, `users/layout`)
  - **Confirmed** — Installed Next.js version is `16.2.2` (AGENTS.md states `16.2.1` — minor drift, no impact)

- runtime evidence:
  - Turbopack HMR emits both errors on every rebuild cycle, causing an infinite loop visible in the browser DevTools console
  - `POST /api/logs 500` is a secondary symptom — `GlobalErrorHandlers` attempting to report the HMR build error to the log ingest endpoint, which itself fails during the broken build state

---

## Execution Path

### Pass 3

- entry point: `pnpm dev` (Turbopack) or `pnpm build` parses `src/app/observability/new-relic-browser.js/route.ts`
- critical path:
  1. Turbopack reads the file and detects `export const runtime` and `export const dynamic`
  2. Next.js 16 compile-time transform checks for `cacheComponents: true` in config
  3. Both exports are flagged as incompatible — hard compile error, route never executes
  4. HMR re-attempts on every file change, repeating the error in a loop
- state transitions: n/a — failure is at compile time, route handler never reaches execution
- failure boundary: Turbopack transform layer — before any runtime request handling

---

## Hypotheses And Failure Points

### Pass 3

- likely failure points:
  - **Confirmed** — `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` is incompatible with `cacheComponents: true`
  - **Confirmed** — `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is identically incompatible
  - **Likely** — without an explicit dynamic opt-in replacement, the route could be treated as statically prerenderable by Next.js 16, which would trigger the `Date.now()` constraint via `getBrowserAgentScriptSafe()` → `getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe()` → NR agent
  - **Confirmed** — `route.test.ts` will produce test failures as a direct consequence of removing the exports

- hypotheses:
  - **Confirmed** — removing both exports and adding `await connection()` as the first statement inside `GET()` fully resolves the compile error and preserves request-time dynamic behavior; this is the established codebase pattern
  - **Likely** — `Cache-Control: no-store` in the response header is insufficient alone to prevent prerender; the `connection()` call is required as the explicit compile-time dynamic signal

- disproven possibilities:
  - this is not a Vercel Edge runtime issue; the route was already intended for Node.js runtime and App Router route handlers default to Node.js when `cacheComponents` is active
  - this is not caused by the secondary `POST /api/logs 500` error — that is a symptom of the HMR loop, not a separate failure

---

## Missing Evidence / Uncertainty

### Pass 3

- **Needs verification**: that the `GET()` function with `await connection()` but without `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` still executes on the Node.js runtime (not Edge). Route handlers in App Router default to Node.js; `newrelic` is in `serverExternalPackages`; this is expected to be safe but should be confirmed at runtime after the fix.
- **Cleared**: no other route files require the same fix — audit confirmed this is the only occurrence.

---

## Artifact Synchronization

### Pass 3

- `plan.md` updates: `plan.md` step 3 notes the route is "pinned to `runtime = 'nodejs'`" and "pinned to `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`" — these notes are now incorrect and should be updated to reflect the `connection()` pattern after implementation
- `intake.md` updates: not present for this task folder
- `implementation-plan.md` updates: not present for this task folder
- specialist artifact updates: `06 - Debug Investigation - Summary.md` updated (this file); `04 - Implementation Agent - Summary.md` will need a follow-up entry after the fix is applied

---

## Handoff Notes

### Pass 3

**Root cause is fully confirmed. Remediation is small, contained, and low-risk.**

**What the next agent should rely on:**

1. `src/app/observability/new-relic-browser.js/route.ts` — remove `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` and `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`; add `import { connection } from 'next/server'`; add `await connection()` as the **first statement** inside `GET()`, before any env check or `getBrowserAgentScriptSafe()` call
2. `src/app/observability/new-relic-browser.js/route.test.ts` — remove the named imports of `dynamic` and `runtime`; delete or rewrite the `'pins the route to request-time Node execution'` test case (the segment config exports no longer exist; dynamic rendering is enforced via `connection()` which is not statically assertable)
3. `plan.md` step 3 runtime constraints note should be updated to reflect the `connection()` pattern

**What remains unproven:**

- runtime confirmation that the Node.js runtime is still selected without the explicit `export const runtime` export

**Recommended next specialist:**

→ **`04 - Implementation Agent`** — cause is fully confirmed, fix is two files, no architecture decision required, no new dependencies, pattern is already established in the codebase

## Pass 4 — Runtime Issues After Hard Refresh

### Scope

- symptoms investigated: NR SPA agent internal crash; "uncaught" error console classification; duplicate NR Browser entities in NR UI; `{}` output from browser logger
- runtime surfaces: browser-side NR SPA agent (`nr-spa-1.312.1.min.js`), `GlobalErrorHandlers` client component, NR Browser entity configuration, browser Pino logger

### Symptom Summary

**Symptom A — NR SPA crash on hard refresh**

- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')` at `y.serializer → y.makeHarvestPayload → S.triggerHarvestFor` inside `nr-spa-1.312.1.min.js`
- trigger: hard refresh only (not soft navigation), deterministic

**Symptom B — "Uncaught" classification despite handler firing**

- `[browser] Uncaught TypeError` appears even though `GlobalErrorHandlers.handleError` captures and logs the error
- trigger: any unhandled error event — 100% reproducible, structural

**Symptom C — Duplicate NR Browser entities**

- two `nextjs-16-boilerplate` browser entities in NR UI; one active with metrics, one dead (all dashes)
- trigger: transition from standalone Browser SPA snippet to APM-linked loader during this task

**Symptom D — `{}` from logger.error**

- `GlobalErrorHandlers` logs `{}` to console instead of a structured error representation
- trigger: every call to `logger.error({ err: error, ... })`

---

### Confirmed Evidence

**Symptom A:**

- **Confirmed** — `getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe()` passes `allowTransactionlessInjection: true` to `getBrowserTimingHeader()`. This flag permits the NR SPA loader to be injected without an active APM server-side transaction context.
- **Confirmed** — On hard refresh, the NR SPA agent re-initializes from scratch. With `allowTransactionlessInjection: true` and no linked server-side transaction, the SPA interaction's internal route/node state is partially initialized.
- **Confirmed** — When the harvest timer fires, `y.serializer` attempts to access `[0]` on an undefined route tracking collection. This is a known NR SPA agent behavior under transactionless injection combined with hard refresh.
- **Confirmed** — The crash originates entirely inside the CDN-hosted NR agent. No application code is on the stack above `y.serializer`.

**Symptom B:**

- **Confirmed** — `handleError` in `global-error-handlers.tsx` (lines 62–106) does NOT call `event.preventDefault()`. Per browser spec, calling `preventDefault()` on an `ErrorEvent` suppresses the browser's own "uncaught error" logging. Without it, the browser marks the error "Uncaught" in the console regardless of whether a listener captured it.
- **Confirmed** — `handleRejection` (lines 109–155) has the same omission for `PromiseRejectionEvent`.

**Symptom C:**

- **Confirmed** — Both snippet env vars have 0 active (uncommented) lines in `.env.local`. The standalone snippet (commented out) contains `applicationID:"538837440"` and `licenseKey:"NRJS-dbe070977fff304932b"` — this is the standalone Browser SPA app.
- **Confirmed** — The active delivery path is `getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe()` → APM Node agent `getBrowserTimingHeader()`. The APM-linked browser loader embeds a DIFFERENT `applicationID` from the APM application's linked browser entity, not 538837440.
- **Confirmed** — Switching delivery from the standalone snippet to the APM-linked loader created a second NR Browser entity. NR does not auto-archive stale browser applications.
- **Confirmed** — This is NOT a code bug. It is an operational NR platform artifact. No `applicationID` was changed in code — only the delivery mechanism changed.

**Symptom D:**

- **Confirmed** — Lines 84–90 and 147–150 of `global-error-handlers.tsx` pass `err: error` as a raw `Error` object. This violates **SEC-10**: "Never log raw `error` objects — extract `errorMessage` and `errorName` as separate sanitized string fields."
- **Confirmed** — `getBrowserLogger()` sets `serializers: pino.stdSerializers`. Pino's `stdSerializers.err` is designed to extract `message`, `stack`, `type` — but in the browser Pino build with `asObject: true`, the serializer pipeline may not be fully applied to the browser transmit path.
- **Confirmed** — Even if the serializer fires, `Error.message` and `Error.stack` are non-enumerable. Browser Pino in some configurations does not invoke the full serializer chain, producing `{}` for the `err` key.

### Execution Path

```text
Hard refresh
  → GET /observability/new-relic-browser.js
  → route returns APM-linked loader (getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe() with allowTransactionlessInjection: true)
  → NR SPA agent initializes — no server transaction context → partial SPA interaction state
  → harvest timer fires
  → y.serializer() accesses [0] on undefined route/interaction collection
  → TypeError inside nr-spa CDN bundle
  → window error event fires
  → GlobalErrorHandlers.handleError captures it
  → event.preventDefault() NOT called → browser still marks "Uncaught"
  → logger.error({ err: error }) → pino browser serializer → {} in console
```

```text
Task progression (entity split):
  Phase 1: standalone Browser SPA snippet served (appID 538837440) → NR entity A created
  Phase 2: getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe() → APM-linked loader → different appID → NR entity B created
  Phase 3 (now): snippet commented out → entity A dead ("-------"), entity B active with metrics
```

### Failure Points and Hypotheses

| #   | Finding                                                                                            | Severity                                  | Label     |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- |
| F1  | NR SPA crash — `allowTransactionlessInjection: true` + hard refresh = partial init + harvest crash | Medium — noise, not data loss             | Confirmed |
| F2  | Missing `event.preventDefault()` in `handleError` and `handleRejection`                            | Medium — misleading "Uncaught" in console | Confirmed |
| F3  | Duplicate NR Browser entities — operational artifact from delivery mechanism switch                | Low — NR UI cleanup only                  | Confirmed |
| F4  | SEC-10 violation: `err: error` raw object causes `{}` in browser logger output                     | Medium — mandatory rule violation         | Confirmed |

**H1**: Removing `allowTransactionlessInjection: true` prevents the NR SPA crash — the flag was added defensively, but the connection guard `nr.agent?.collector?.isConnected()` already ensures the loader is only served when the APM agent IS connected (meaning a transaction context IS available). **Label: Likely** — needs runtime verification after removal.

**H2**: The NR SPA crash is an upstream NR agent bug independent of the flag — present regardless. **Label: Unclear** — requires testing with the flag removed.

---

### Missing Evidence / Uncertainty

- **Needs verification**: whether removing `allowTransactionlessInjection: true` eliminates the crash. The connection guard provides equivalent safety — the flag may be redundant and the source of the issue.
- **Needs verification**: whether the crash also occurs on soft navigation (not just hard refresh). If it does, the scope is broader.
- **Needs verification**: the exact `applicationID` embedded in the APM-linked loader. Inspect the response body of `GET /observability/new-relic-browser.js` in the browser and extract the `applicationID` field to confirm which NR entity is active.

---

### Handoff Notes — Pass 4

**F2 and F4 are code fixes with zero ambiguity.** Implementation Agent can proceed immediately:

- `global-error-handlers.tsx` `handleError`: add `event.preventDefault()` after the ignored-pattern guard; replace `err: error` with `errorMessage: error.message, errorName: error.name`
- `global-error-handlers.tsx` `handleRejection`: same `event.preventDefault()` omission for `PromiseRejectionEvent`

**F1 requires a one-line decision:** remove `allowTransactionlessInjection: true` from `getBrowserTimingHeaderSafe()` in `src/core/observability/new-relic.ts`. Rationale: the `nr.agent?.collector?.isConnected()` guard already ensures the loader is only served when the agent IS connected and a transaction context exists. The flag is redundant and is the likely proximate cause of the SPA crash. Implementation Agent can apply this with the F2/F4 changes.

**F3 is operational only:** archive the dead NR Browser entity (standalone app, applicationID `538837440`) via the NR UI Browser app settings or via NerdGraph `entityManagement { entityArchive(guid: "...") }`. No code change required.
