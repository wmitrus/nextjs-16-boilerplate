# Getting Started Runbooks

This folder contains practical, step-by-step runbooks for launching the boilerplate in different operating modes.

Start here if you are new to the repository and want a deterministic setup path.

## Available Runbooks

1. [Local Quickstart - Single Tenant](./01%20-%20Local%20Quickstart%20-%20Single%20Tenant.md)
2. [Verification Runbook - Security Showcase (Single Tenant)](<./02%20-%20Verification%20Runbook%20-%20Security%20Showcase%20(Single%20Tenant).md>)

## Scope Rules

- Runbooks focus on executable steps (commands + required values).
- Architecture rationale stays in `docs/architecture/*`.
- Feature internals stay in `docs/features/*`.
- If a runbook depends on another doc, it links directly to it.

## Planned Next Runbooks

- Multi-tenant local setup
- Team onboarding flow (shared dev environments)
- CI-like local setup (local Postgres + DB test profile)
- Production-like smoke setup
